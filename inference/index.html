          Major updates and additions to the inference package are in progress.
          The internal documentation (docstrings viewable in interactive Python
          sessions) has been kept up-to-date, and it's viewable here via the API
          documentation link in the sidebar. We're slowly but steadily providing
          more friendly documentation here. Please check back as we add content,
          move prototype modules out of the sandbox, and build new examples.

      <h1>The <span class="modname">inference</span> Package</h1>

      <div id="pagetoc">
        <h2>Page Contents</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Overview</li>
          <li>A Library and a Framework</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        The <span class="modname">inference</span> package is a collection of
        Python modules implementing a variety of methods targeting the
        statistical inference problems&#151;and the statistical modeling
        <em>style</em>&#151;of the physical sciences. Our own discipline is
        astronomy, and our choice of problems and methods most directly targets
        the needs of astronomers, but many tools here may be of use to other
        physical scientists.
      </p>

      <p>
        We adopt a narrow view of <em>statistical inference</em> for this
        package: we strive to provide tools that not only provide a "best"
        estimate or choice in a problem, but that also
        <em>quantify uncertainties</em>. For many scientific purposes, merely
        knowing what's "best" is not enough; we also need to know the range of
        possibilities that are "nearly as good." That's the kind of science the
        <span class="modname">inference</span> package aims to address.
      </p>

      <div class="warning">
        The <span class="modname">inference</span> package is currently
        beta-quality software. Many modules are essentially release-quality, but
        deserve the beta designation because of limited documentation. Other
        modules are not quite thoroughly tested or have evolving interfaces;
        these are mostly in the <span class="modname">sandbox</span> (in the
        source repository). We are slowly but steadily expanding the package,
        both in methods and documentation; please check back from time to time
        if <span class="modname">inference</span>
        appears on the right track but doesn't yet meet your needs.

      <h2>A Library and a Framework</h2>

      <p>
        The modules comprising the
        <span class="modname">inference</span> package fall into two categories:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Library modules:</strong> These modules implement tools that
          are largely self-contained. They fall into three categories:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Statistical tools:</em> These modules implement statistical
            methods targeting specific, focused problems, such as estimating
            rates from Poisson-distributed event counts, or fitting a line to
            data with errors in both abscissa and ordinate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Utilities:</em> These modules implement computational algorithms
            that are useful for statistical computation, but which may be useful
            in other settings; examples include multi-dimensional numerical
            integration and Monte Carlo algorithms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Signal models:</em> These modules implement functions and
            classes for calculating predictions from selected widely-used models
            in astronomy and physics, such as Keplerian models for orbital
            motion, or cosmological models for the distribution of luminous
            sources in space-time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Parametric Inference Engine (PIE):</strong> These modules
          comprise a framework facilitating exploring the parameter spaces of
          statistical models for data, for three different general modeling
          approaches: <em>chi-squared</em> (or nonlinear weighted least
          squares), <em>maximum likelihood</em>, and <em>Bayesian</em>.
